lfm - Last File Manager
=======================

file that comes with this package. There is NO WARRANTY.


Introduction:
=============
'Last File Manager' is (tries to be) a simple 'midnight commander'-type
application for UNIX console.

From version 0.6 and higher lfm package also contains 'pyview', a
simple python viewer to be used with lfm. Read README.pyview for 
more info on it.

Lfm and Pyview are written in python and use curses module.

It has been tested on next platforms:

O.S.           PYTHON     Arch
-------------------------------------------------
Linux 2.4.12   2.1.1      i686
Solaris 8      2.1        UltraSparc-II (1)

(1) I needed to install ncurses and recompile python to use them. 
    It doesn't work with the curses library which comes with Solaris 8.

I hope it works in other UNIXes as well.
It seems it doesn't work on OpenBSD, perhaps due to the version of ncurses
library it has.

It needs Python v2.0 or higher, it won't work with v1.5.

Also, take a look at TODO file to see bugs and not implemented features.

Type 'lfm --help' for a complete list of options.

Program preferences are saved in '~/.lfmrc' file.
When the program starts the first time, it tries to discover the programs
in your system to configure lfm automatically, but it's not perfect, so
you should take a look to the configuration (General Menu [F9] -> Edit
Configuration [c]) and change according to your preferences.


Install
=======
'lfm' doesn't work unless you install it, but don't worry, it's very easy.

From rpm (RedHat-type linux system):
type as root:   # rpm -Uvh lfm-version-noarch.rpm

From source (any UNIX):
uncompress file
type:           $ python setup.py build
and as root:    # python setup.py install	

and then just type 'lfm' to run it.

To let lfm to change to panel's current directory after quiting with
'q', 'Q' or F10 keys, you must add to /etc/bashrc or to your ~/.bashrc
next code:

  lfm()
  {
	/usr/bin/lfm $*		# type here full path to lfm executable
	LFMPATHFILE=/tmp/lfm-$$.path
	cd `cat $LFMPATHFILE`
	rm -f $LFMPATHFILE
  }

If you don't use bash or csh shell, above lines must be different.


Upgrading
=========
If you upgrade from version <= 0.5, please remove ~/.lfmrc to regenerate
a valid configuration file.

History:
========
Some years ago I began to write a program like this in C, but after
some weeks of coding I never finished it... I'm too lazy, yes.
Now, once I've seen the light, I am writing 'lfm' to learn python.


Thanks:
=======

Thanks are obviously due to the whole python community, specially to GvR 
(of course! ;-) and all the people who answered my questions in c.l.p.
It's a great pleasure to code in a language like this.

Alexei Gilchrist, for his cfm program from which I took some ideas.

Midnight Commander developers, whose program was the guide.
