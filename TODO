General:
========
+ mc: Alt-O
      Alt-T => .
      Alt-Y/U => < / > historic

+ .rpm vfs

+ handle windows resizing in X (low priority)

+ a gui for configuring colors (very low priority)


Bugs:
=====
+ vfs: - .tar.gz inside a .tar.gz file (vfs in vfs)
       - in case of 'panelize' vfs type (after find/grep), deleted / moved 
         files are not deleted / moved in real path
       - tmpdir are showed in the copy/move/... dialogs or when view/edit/...
         a file, instead of vfs dir (this is just a estetic issue)

+ lfm.run_thread: sometimes some processes remain as zombies when stopped 
                  by user or because of an error

+ lfm.Tree, pyview.InternalView: cursor appears after keystroke regards
  curses.curs_set(0): bug in ncurses?

+ lfm crashes in X when resizing terminal => handle SIGWINCH signal

+ keys in Solaris terminal: look at Oleg Broytmann's mail in c.l.p

Hacks:
======
+ Python os.stat doesn't have rdev in returned tuple,
  which is needed for devices major and minor numbers

+ Idem with 'getmntent' to get filesystem type

+ The first time Panel.__init_dir is executed, it needs to know prefs,
  so there is a hack to get it working

+ Added a '0x1B' char capture to avoid extra input with HOME and END keys
  in xterm and gnome-terminal (rxvt worked ok)

+ We need to use a shell hack to change the directory after lfm exists
