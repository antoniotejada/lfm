General:
========
High Priority:
	+ speed up:
		- copy, move, delete
	+ historic navigation: mc: Alt-Y / Alt-U : < / >
	+ scroll bar indicator when copying, moving or deleting
	+ complex commands, make it configurable:
		- show directory under cursor in the other panel: mc: Alt+O
    + write doc section about preferences in .lfmrc

Low Priority (maybe some day):
	+ make sort mode per panel, not globally
	+ .rpm vfs
	+ alt+keys
	+ i18n
	+ pyview: tab 4/8 chars
	+ exclude files (f.e. *.o) to grep

Very Low Priority (never):
	+ use optparse instead of getopt
	+ use logging module for debugging
	+ mouse
	+ a gui for configuring colors


Bugs:
=====
+ vfs: - .tar.gz inside a .tar.gz file (vfs in vfs)
       - in case of 'panelize' vfs type (after find/grep), deleted / moved 
         files are not deleted / moved in real path
       - tmpdir are showed in the copy/move/... dialogs or when view/edit/...
         a file, instead of vfs dir (this is just a estetic issue)

+ lfm.run_thread: sometimes some processes remain as zombies when stopped 
                  by user or because of an error

+ keys in Solaris terminal: look at Oleg Broytmann's mail in c.l.p

Hacks:
======
+ 'app' global variable is badly carried from function to function

+ Python os.stat doesn't have rdev in returned tuple,
  which is needed for devices major and minor numbers

+ Idem with 'getmntent' to get filesystem type

+ The first time Panel.__init_dir is executed, it needs to know prefs,
  so there is a hack to get it working

+ We need to use a shell hack to change the directory after lfm exists
