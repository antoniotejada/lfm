General:
========
+ copy, move, delete (?): walk dirs => bug #1

+ Enter: if .tar.gz / .tar.bz2 => vfs

+ find/grep: panelize => vfs

+ F2, f: file menu
	y - encrypt/decrypt file

+ F9: Menu
	t - tree

+ Ctrl-t: show tree

+ preferences: edit, load/save historic


Bugs:
=====
+ Overwrite dirs when moving or copying => walk dirs
  f.e.    panel1:   dir/a      panel2:   dir/b
                       /b                   /c
  Now when moving dir from panel1 to panel2, the 'dir' destination
  is overwritten, so 'c'-file is lost. This is not the desired
  behaviour

+ pyview.py: if wrap mode => fix prev/next page & up/down cursor

+ if panel2 shows 'a' directory and in panel1 'a' is deleted, lfm crashes

+ pyview.py: chars >= 0xA0 are showed in reversed video on Linux

+ lfm.run_thread: sometimes some processes remain as zombies when stopped 
                  by user or because of an error

+ pyview.py.InternalView: cursor appears after keystroke regards
  curses.curs_set(0)

+ messages.SelectItem, messages.FindfilesWin, messages.MenuWin,
  messages.ChangePerms: upperleft corner disappears

+ lfm crashes in X when resizing terminal => handle SIGWINCH signal

+ keys in Solaris terminal: look at Oleg Broytmann's mail in c.l.p

Some vague future ideas:
========================
+ look at distutils.file_util, distutils.dir_util, distutil.filelist, ...

+ what happens with integer division???


Hacks:
======
+ Python os.stat doesn't have rdev in returned tuple,
  which is needed for devices major and minor numbers

+ Idem with 'getmntent' to get filesystem type

+ The first time Panel.__init_dir is executed, it needs to know prefs,
  so there is a hack to get it working

+ Added a '0x1B' char capture to avoid extra input with HOME and END keys
  in xterm and gnome-terminal (rxvt worked ok)

+ Completition code is a mess: we need to know panels path, but inside
  files.py and messages.py files we don't have access to 'app'

+ We need to use a shell hack to change the directory after lfm exists
