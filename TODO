Not Yet Implemented:
====================
+ F1, h: help

+ F2, f: file menu
	p - perms, owner, group
	i - file info
	@ - do something with file
	g - gzip / gunzip
	b - bzip2 / bunzip2
	x - uncompress (tar.gz, tar.bz2)
	c - compress (..)
	y - encrypt/decrypt file

+ F9: Menu
	/ - find, grep
	  - df -k
	  - du -sk
	t - tree
	s - shell
	b - edit bookmarks
	c - configuration  
	  - save configuration

+ /: find, grep

+ i: file info

+ Ctrl-t: show tree

+ Enter: do something with file
	tar.gz / tar.bz2: enter
	gr: view graphically
	...


General:
========
+ exit to the current directory, look at mc hack

+ preferences: load, save, edit
	- apps: shell, pager, editor
	- confirmations: overwrite, delete
	- sort: mode, mix_dirs, mix_cases
	- historic: ?

+ if action is time-consuming => threads... => | \ - /

+ check if arg[1] = file, not a dir => view

+ look at distutils.file_util, distutils.dir_util, distutil.filelist, ...

+ document functions and modules


HACKS:
======
+ Python os.stat doesn't have rdev in returned tuple,
  which is needed for devices major and minor numbers

+ The first time Panel.__init_dir is executed, it needs to know prefs,
  so there is a hack to get it working

+ Added a '0x1B' char capture to avoid extra input with HOME and END keys
  in xterm and gnome-terminal (rxvt worked ok)

+ Completition code is a mess: we need to know panels path, but inside
  files.py and messages.py files we don't have access to 'app'


BUGS:
=====
+ lfm crashes in X when resizing terminal => handle SIGWINCH signal

+ if panel2 has dir. 'a' and in panel1 it is deleted, it crashs

+ keys in Solaris terminal: look at the mail of Oleg Broytmann in c.l.p
