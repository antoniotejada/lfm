Not Yet Implemented:
====================
+ F1, h: help

+ F2, f: file menu
	i - file info
	y - encrypt/decrypt file

+ F9: Menu
	t - tree

+ i: file info

+ Ctrl-t: show tree

+ Enter: do something with file
	tar.gz / tar.bz2: enter
	gr: view graphically
	...


General:
========
+ rewrite messages.show_fs_info()

+ capture output when executing file: ENTER, @

+ check errors while un/compressing

+ find/grep: panelize

+ preferences: edit, load/save historic

+ if action is time-consuming => threads... => | \ - /

+ internal viewer

+ look at distutils.file_util, distutils.dir_util, distutil.filelist, ...

+ document functions


Hacks:
======
+ Python os.stat doesn't have rdev in returned tuple,
  which is needed for devices major and minor numbers

+ Idem with 'getmnent' to get filesystem type

+ The first time Panel.__init_dir is executed, it needs to know prefs,
  so there is a hack to get it working

+ Added a '0x1B' char capture to avoid extra input with HOME and END keys
  in xterm and gnome-terminal (rxvt worked ok)

+ Completition code is a mess: we need to know panels path, but inside
  files.py and messages.py files we don't have access to 'app'

+ We need to use a shell hack to change the directory after lfm exists


Bugs:
=====
+ messages.SelectItem, messages.FindfilesWin, messages.MenuWin,
  messages.ChangePerms: upperleft corner disappears

+ lfm crashes in X when resizing terminal => handle SIGWINCH signal

+ if panel2 has dir. 'a' and in panel1 'a' is deleted, lfm crashes

+ keys in Solaris terminal: look at the mail of Oleg Broytmann in c.l.p
